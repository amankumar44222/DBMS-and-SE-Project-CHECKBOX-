CHECKBOX ( Attendance Management System )

We would like to express our special thanks of gratitude 
to our teachers Dr. Uma Madam and Dr Manjunath Sir to 
gave us the golden opportunity to do this wonderful 
project CHECKBOX, which also helped us in doing a lot 
of research and coding and we came to know about so 
many new things. We are really thankful to them.

This is a dynamic website for teachers/mentors/tutors etc 
to manage attendance record of students easily without 
getting involved in the mess of entering the records 
manually in registers. This websites ensure maintenance 
of proper attendance records by the teachers without 
getting seen or edited by any others which allows safe and 
exact attendance records. The teachers here can record 
everyday’s attendance and can view the report in 
graphical manner and can download average class 
attendance and record of each student’s attendance in 
required format. Students can also view their daily 
attendance report and can observe the percentage 
attendance so that they could maintain the minimum 
attendance mark.
